# Tiny Url

Developed a REST API web service using Spring Boot in Java. Implemented URL shortening functionality with advanced  

features for monitoring, tracking, and viewing statistics. Utilized Redis, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Docker to ensure effective  

data storage and management.


## Tech Stack
### Redis - For saving the urls information in order to enable mapping from the original url to the shortened one
### Mongo - For managing and storing users information related to their requests 
### Cassandra - For storing users activity about urls requests.
### Docker - For Containerization
